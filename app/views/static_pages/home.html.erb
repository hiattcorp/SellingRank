  <h1 class="page-header">"What is SellingRank?</h1>

  <p class="lead">SellingRank.com is the first company in the world dedicated to the training and global ranking of
    sales professionals.
  </p>
  <p class="lead">That sounds great but why does the world need this?
  </p>
  <p>
    For decades salespeople and companies have paid a great deal of money to test salespeople in an effort to determine
    their aptitude for sales. We thought it was time to change that model, not only do we test for aptitude but we test
    score and rank based on performance history and skills. Salespeople can then use their rank on resumes and with
    recruiters, to boast on LinkedIn, or simply compete with your colleagues.

    This is just the beginning, we have many iterations and changes in the coming months and years.
